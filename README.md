<b>Requirements</b>
<ul>
  <ul>
      <li>Some modules of python should be imported, those are: </li>
        <ul>
          <li>random</li>
          <li>string</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

  Firstly, this program generates a random password and that password is used again to solving. The program uses all letters, characters, numbers when generating a password.
  It takes a length as number from user and then generates a random password using this length. The other operations start after password is created. Finally, the output will 
  be equal to random password.

<p>For instance;</p>
<pre>
  Enter your password length: 3
  Random password is mno
  Password solved !
  Your password is " mno " 
</pre>
